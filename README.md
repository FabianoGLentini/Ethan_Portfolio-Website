Absolutely! Here's the revised structure with the Figma Design Preview section placed before the Design Process & Client Contribution section in the README.md:

# Sound Design Portfolio Website

This website was developed for a client's sound design portfolio. The visual design was meticulously crafted using Figma, aligning closely with the client's sound design style. The design was brought to life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an atmospheric experience that resonates with the sound designer's work.

## Figma Design Preview

## Design Process & Client Contribution

The visual design was created using Figma, ensuring it matched the client's sound design aesthetics. As part of the ambiance-building strategy, the client contributed images, utilizing their photography hobby, which serve as a key asset in enhancing the overall atmosphere of the website. This design concept was then implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a captivating web experience that complements the sound designer's work.

## Ongoing Development

Continuing forward, the focus remains on refining the user experience. This involves further development of page effects, enhancing page responsiveness, and ensuring the effective showcase of the sound designer's portfolio.

## Future Expansion

There are plans to expand the website by adding more pages in the future. This expansion aims to offer a broader display of the sound designer's portfolio, enriching the user experience.
