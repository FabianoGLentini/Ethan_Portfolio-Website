# Sound Design Portfolio Website

A custom-built, fully responsive portfolio website developed for a professional sound designer. This project combines **immersive visual design** with **modern web development practices** to showcase creative work in audio and sound design. The site was designed in **Figma** and developed using **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**, with an emphasis on performance optimization, cross-device compatibility, and responsive layout techniques.

## Visual & User Experience Design

The design was tailored to reflect the clientâ€™s aesthetic and creative identity:

* Minimalist interface inspired by cinematic soundscapes.
* Smooth scrolling and transitions to guide user engagement.
* Custom photography provided by the client, integrated to enhance immersion.
* Design mockups created in **Figma** and implemented using responsive web layouts.
