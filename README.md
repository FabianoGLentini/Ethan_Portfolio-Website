# Sound Design Portfolio Website

A custom-built portfolio website designed and developed for a sound designer client, this project merges **immersive visuals** with a minimalist layout to showcase creative work in audio and sound design. The site was designed in **Figma** and developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with careful attention paid to creating an atmospheric experience that complements the artistâ€™s style.

## Collaborative Process

This project was a collaborative effort between designer and client. The client provided visual assets through their own photography, which were integrated into the layout to enhance atmosphere and thematic coherence. From initial mockups to final implementation, the focus remained on achieving a cohesive digital presence tailored to the clientâ€™s portfolio and style.
